relational and comparison operator:
>,<,>=,<=,==,!=,===(identical)
relational or comparison operator return a Boolean value

difference between the == and ===
=== additionally checks the data type and condition
let a=10;
let b='10';
console.log(a==b);=>True
console.log(a===b);=>False

logical operator:
=>and(both the condition are true){0,0=>0;0,1=>0;1,0=>0;1,1=>1;}
=>or(any one condition is true)
=>not

Assignment operator:
+=,-=,*=,/=,%=


a+=b=>a=a+b

Unary operator:
=>++
=>--
which just works with a single variable;

ex: a++,a--=> a=a+1,a=-1

ternary operator:

? :
condition? instruction to be executed : else instruction 




Loops 
Entry control loop -for, while
Exit control loop - do while


for syntax:
for(initialization ; condition; increment;){
}
ex:
for(let i=1;i<=10;i++){
statement to be executed}


while Loop: 

initialization ,declaration;
while(condition){
statements to be executed}

Do while loop:
let I =10


Two types of functions:
=>user defined functions:(4 Types)
-no argument no return
-no argument with return
-with argument no return
-with argument with return 



=>predefined fucntions(array,objects,math,string,datatype)


TODO List using array functions

push array method (predefined){to add a element in the end of an array}


forEach-for loop to access the each element in a array
